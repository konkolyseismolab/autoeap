# autoEAP - Automated Extended Aperture Photometry, developed for high amplitude K2 variable stars

The details of Extended Aperture Photometry are published in [Plachy et al.,2019,ApJS,244,32](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..244...32P/abstract).
A short summary of automatization is published [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200908786P/abstract).

## Installation

To install the package, use:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/zabop/autoeap
```
if you fail, try instead:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zabop/autoeap
cd autoeap
python  setup.py install
```

## Example usage

To create your own photomery, you'll need a Target Pixel File, such as [this one.](https://github.com/zabop/autoeap/blob/master/examples/ktwo212466080-c17_lpd-targ.fits)
Then, after starting Python, you can do:

```python
yourtpf = '/path/to/your/tpf/ktwo212466080-c17_lpd-targ.fits'
import autoeap
time, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(yourtpf)
```

Or if you want to let autoEAP download the TPF from MAST database, you can just provide a target name and a campaign number:

```python
import autoeap
targetID = 'EPIC 212466080'
campaign = 17
time, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(targetID,campaign=campaign)
```

**With this last line, you can create autoEAP photometry for any K2 variable star.**

Plotting our results gives:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.scatter(time,flux,marker='+',c='r')
plt.show()
```

The details of the workflow is described in [docs](https://github.com/zabop/autoeap/tree/master/docs).

You can find Google Colab friendly tutorial [in the examples](https://github.com/zabop/autoeap/tree/master/examples).

### Apply K2 Systematics Correction (K2SC)
If you want to apply K2SC correction for your freshly made raw-photometry, first you should install [K2SC](https://github.com/OxES/k2sc). AutoEAP is based on that package, so if you find K2SC useful, please cite [Aigrain et al.,2016,MNRAS,459,2408](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.459.2408A/abstract).

Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/OxES/k2sc.git
cd k2sc
python setup.py install --user
```
And then without much hassle, you can use in python:
```python
import autoeap
time, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(yourtpf,apply_K2SC=True)
```

The result is quite delightful:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.scatter(time,flux,marker='+',c='r')
plt.show()
```

### Apply spline correction
We have also built-in a method to remove trends using low-order splines. Just do to correct the raw light curve:
```python
import autoeap
time, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(yourtpf,remove_spline=True)
```

Or do this to remove a spline from the K2SC light curve:
```python
import autoeap
time, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(yourtpf,apply_K2SC=True,remove_spline=True)
```

## Available options
 - `apply_K2SC` If `True`, after the raw photomery, K2SC will be applied to remove systematics from the extracted light curve.
 - `remove_spline` If `True`, after the raw photomery, a low-order spline will be fitted and removed from the extracted light curve. If ``apply_K2SC`` is also `True`, then this step will be done after the K2SC.
 - `save_lc` If `True`, the final light curve will be save as a file.
 - `campaign` If local TPF file is not found, it will be downloaded from MAST, but ``campaign`` number should be defined as well, if the target has been observed in more than one campaign.
 - `TH` Threshold to segment each target in each TPF candence. Only used if targets cannot be separated normally. Default is `8`.
 - `show_plots` If `True`, all the plots will be displayed.
 - `save_plots` If `True`, all the plots will be saved to a subdirectory.
 - `window_length` The length of filter window for spline correction given in days. Applies only if ``remove_spline`` is `True`. Default is `20` days.
 
## Data Access

We provide photometry for targets for the following Guest Observation Programs:
```GO12111,GO8037,GO13111,GO14058,GO6082,GO16058,GO18033,GO10037,GO15058,GO17033.```

Slightly less than 2000 RRLs. See: [K2 approved targets & programs.](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-approved-programs.html)

The data we have already created have been uploaded to our [webpage](https://konkoly.hu/KIK/data_en.html).
