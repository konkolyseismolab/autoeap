# autoEAP - Automated Extended Aperture Photometry, developed for high amplitude K2 variable stars

The details of Extended Aperture Photometry are published in [Plachy et al.,2019,ApJS,244,32](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..244...32P/abstract).
A short summary of automatization is published [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200908786P/abstract).

## Installation

To install the package, use:

```bash
pip install autoeap
```

## Example usage

To create your own photomery, you'll need a Target Pixel File, such as [this one.](https://github.com/zabop/autoeap/blob/master/examples/ktwo212466080-c17_lpd-targ.fits)
Then, after starting Python, you can do:

```python
yourtpf = '/path/to/your/tpf/ktwo212466080-c17_lpd-targ.fits'

import autoeap

time, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(yourtpf)
```

Or if you want to let autoEAP download the TPF from MAST database, you can just provide a target name and a campaign number:

```python
import autoeap

targetID = 'EPIC 212466080'
campaign = 17
time, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(targetID,campaign=campaign)
```

**With this last line, you can create autoEAP photometry for any K2 variable star.**

Plotting our results gives:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(time,flux,'.')
plt.xlabel('KBJD')
plt.ylabel('Flux')
plt.show()
```

The details of the workflow is described in [docs](https://github.com/zabop/autoeap/tree/master/docs).

You can find Google Colab friendly tutorials [in the examples](https://github.com/zabop/autoeap/tree/master/examples).

### Apply K2 Systematics Correction (K2SC)
If you want to apply K2SC correction for your freshly made raw-photometry, first you should install [K2SC](https://github.com/OxES/k2sc). AutoEAP is based on that package, so if you find K2SC useful, please cite [Aigrain et al.,2016,MNRAS,459,2408](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.459.2408A/abstract).

Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/OxES/k2sc.git
cd k2sc
python setup.py install --user
```

If it fails, try to install it with ``george``:
```
pip3 install george k2sc
```

And then without much hassle, you can use in python:
```python
import autoeap

time, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(yourtpf,apply_K2SC=True)
```

The result is quite delightful:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(time,flux,'.')
plt.xlabel('KBJD')
plt.ylabel('Flux')
plt.show()
```

### Apply spline correction
We have also built-in a method to remove trends using low-order splines. Just do to correct the raw light curve:
```python
import autoeap

time, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(yourtpf,remove_spline=True)
```

Or do this to remove a spline from the K2SC light curve:
```python
import autoeap

time, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(yourtpf,apply_K2SC=True,remove_spline=True)
```

## Available options
 - `apply_K2SC` If `True`, after the raw photomery, K2SC will be applied to remove systematics from the extracted light curve.
 - `remove_spline` If `True`, after the raw photomery, a low-order spline will be fitted and removed from the extracted light curve. If ``apply_K2SC`` is also `True`, then this step will be done after the K2SC.
 - `save_lc` If `True`, the intermediate and the final light curves will be save as a file.
 - `campaign` If local TPF file is not found, it will be downloaded from MAST, but ``campaign`` number should be defined as well, if the target has been observed in more than one campaign. Otherwise that campaign will be used in which the target were first observed.
 - `show_plots` If `True`, all the plots will be displayed.
 - `save_plots` If `True`, all the plots will be saved to a subdirectory.
 - `window_length` The length of filter window for spline correction given in days. Applies only if ``remove_spline`` is `True`. Default is `20` days.
 - `sigma_lower` The number of standard deviations to use as the lower bound for sigma clipping limit before spline correction. Applies only if ``remove_spline`` is `True`. Default is `3`.
 - `sigma_upper` The number of standard deviations to use as the upper bound for sigma clipping limit before spline correction. Applies only if ``remove_spline`` is `True`. Default is `3`.
 - `outlier_ratio` Missing value threshold in % below which position correction values (POS_CORR) are used for K2SC. Missing POS_CORR values will reduce the light curve points! Otherwise, less reliable photometrically estimated centroids will be used. Default is `2`.
  - `TH` Threshold to segment each target in each TPF candence. Only used if targets cannot be separated normally. Default is `8`. Do not change this value unless you are aware of what you are doing!
  - `ROI_lower` The aperture frequency grid range of interest threshold given in absolute number of selections above which pixels are considered to define the apertures.  Do not change this value unless you are aware of what you are doing! Default is `100`.
  - `ROI_upper` The aperture frequency grid range of interest threshold given in relative number of selections w.r.t. the number of all cadences below which pixels are considered to define the apertures. Do not change this value unless you are aware of what you are doing! Default is `0.85`.
- `**kwargs` Dictionary of arguments to be passed to ``k2sc.detrend``.

## Command-line tools
After installation, ``autoEAP`` will be available from the command line:
